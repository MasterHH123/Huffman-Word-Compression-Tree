Huffman Word Compression Tree in Java :D

Huffman coding is a type of variable-length encoding used for lossless data compression. The algorithm builds a compression scheme for encoding data, where frequently occurring characters are assigned shorter codes and less frequent characters are assigned longer codes. This results in a compressed representation of the original data, reducing its size without losing any information.
